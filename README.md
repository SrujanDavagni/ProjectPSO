# ProjectPSO
This project proposes a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)-based intelligent traffic management system aimed at minimizing traffic congestion and optimizing signal timings.
By integrating V2X (Vehicle-to-Everything) communication, the system ensures real-time data exchange between vehicles, roadside units, and the control center.
